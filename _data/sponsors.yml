      live office hours, you'll improve your Python one week at a time. 
      New cohorts start every 1-2 months, at both beginner and advanced levels. 
      Also, Residents of India get a 40% discount on WPE and all of Reuven Lerner's courses -- including NumPy, Pandas, and object-oriented Python.
