### About Conference

PyConf Hyderabad is the regional gathering for the community that uses and develops the open-source Python programming language. PyConf Hyderabad is organised by the Hyderabad Python User Group (HydPy) for the community. This conference is about sharing of knowledge, experience and allowing the growth of ideas which could lead to spillover of stronger ties between developers and users of Python with human interactions.


### About Us

Hyderabad Python User Group (HydPy) is community driven group to promote Python in Hyderabad. HydPy has been conducting monthly Meetups & workshops in Hyderabad for last 2 years and it has over 4500 members. We work together with other communities in particular, python and in general Open Source Software (OSS) related groups within Hyderabad and the rest of India to further expand the usage and increase users of OSS. HydPy is a recognised regional community by Python Software Society India (PSSI) and global Python Software Foundation (PSF).
